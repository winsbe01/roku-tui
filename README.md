# roku-tui
a command line TUI remote for Roku

## basic usage

## typing mode
In some instances, you may need to type something into a Roku screen 
(when searching or logging into a service, for example). This can be 
incredibly cumbersome using the standard navigation.

To enter typing mode, press `/`, and you will see a cursor appear below 
the remote. At this point, all alphanumeric keys (and backspace) will 
be interpreted literally and sent to the Roku.

To exit typing mode, press `ENTER` or `ESC`.

NOTE: this doesn't work with all text interfaces.
